            we are ‘YOU’. We’ve studied medicine abroad with the intention of making ourselves a qualified medical professional. Living and studying abroad has allowed us to master the lifestyle and all the ‘hacks’ necessary for a smooth transition. We know exactly what students need, and we will be by your side helping you in every step of the way. We are students on the ground, inside the campus, and with strong internal connections within the universities. Once you do get accepted and come abroad, we are with you for six years. We’re living in the same city as you

            we’ve learnt the same content as you and we’ve experienced every difficulty that you are likely to encounter. We have learned so much from being abroad and we would love to pass this knowledge on to you. Think of it this way, once you’re a medical student, who will help you when you have problems in the course? A consultant sitting in an office in India or an older student who has gone through the same seminars, exams and life-style as you are going now.Try us. You won’t regret it!

    <p>
        We care for our student’s safety and betterment in their respective country of stay. Taking this into consideration, we stay with our students in their country of study throughout the whole duration of their course. So, during the course of study, if any kind of problem arises for our students, they can approach us anytime personally.
